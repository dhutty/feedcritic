# Feedcritic

Feedcritic is very much a work in progress. For now, please see the short description at http://wiki.greptilian.com/ideas and the notes at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oAw9vik_MNMZlSue3W4FY4ba46bfG0XrlWx0aRvsFso/edit?usp=sharing

The basic idea is that a lot of data can be downloaded from your list of podcasts. The starting point is an OPML file, which podcatchers such as [AntennaPod](http://antennapod.org) allow you to export. Feedcritic downloads each feed, an XML file, and extracts information from it.
